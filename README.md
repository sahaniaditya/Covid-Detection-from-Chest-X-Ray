# Covid-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray
# This project deals with the covid-19 detection from chest X-ray using various methods and a comparitive study between them. HOG features are computed and then models like Random Forest classifier, Decision Tree classifier , Gaussian NB ,kNeighbours classifier and logistic regression.
